/*
Data Types

There are a bunch of different integer types:
    I8: -128...127
    u8: 0...255
    i16... -> i128, u128

    isize and usize are depending on the arcitecture of the computer... 
    if it is an x32 computer, then it will be i32, u32, and the same for x64
*/


/*
Variables

    by default variables are immutable, but con be changed to mutable



 For instance

let two = 2;
let mut my_name = "Bill";

*/


/*
functions / println

fn main() {
    println!("Hello, World!");
}

the exclamation point after "println" indicates that we are using a macro intead of a function

let life = 42;

println!("{:?}", life)
println!("{life:?}")
the :? is for debugging, the normal one below is for user display
println!("{life}")
*/


/*

let mut a = 0;
loop {
    if a == 5 {
        break;
    }
    println!("{:?}, a");
    a = a + 1;
}

while a != 5 {
    println!("{:?}", a);
    a = a + 1;
}
